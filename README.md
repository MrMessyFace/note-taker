# Notes App
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

## Description

I was tasked with creating a working note taking app that saves each note separately in a tab that you can select at a later time and continue to edit it as well as add new notes.

## Installation

I used Node.js, Express, and UUID.

## Usage

When a user opens the webpage, they can start adding notes to the site and can delete any notes at any time.
